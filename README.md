# Gold-star-Technical-Writing-Roadmap

Welcome to the **Technical Writing Roadmap** ‚Äî a free, open-source guide for anyone looking to become a skilled technical writer.

Learning how to write has never been easy. I have collected a pool of resources that I wish I had when I started. This repo is a collection of resources to help you get started with technical writing. In time I hope to develop this into more comprehensive resource as is with The Odin Project for developers, only this time, writing is the topic.
