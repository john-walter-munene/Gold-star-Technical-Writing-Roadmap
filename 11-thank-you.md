## Thank you

Thanks for following up with me on the three weeks technical writing program. We have received a bulk of resources. I believe they are more than enough to help you break through your technical writing career. Feel free to circle back to the topics you find overwhelming. If you have any questions, drop them here. I'm always ready to help you.

If you enjoyed the program, I'd love it if you followed me on Twitter, where I talk about Web development, technical writing, and Web3. (https://twitter.com/munene254_). I will continue sharing my newly acquired insights on these areas here as of May. I'll continue building my personal monopoly over there. Maybe you should too...

If you didn't get an inspiration, I'm sorry I couldn't break down storytelling any further. You may therefore need to seek alternative resources or paths. If you'd like a paid program, I recommend The Write of Passage by David Perell. That will cost you only $300.

As you forge your own path toward success as a writer, don't forget to check in with these final resources.

The Ultimate Guide to Online Writing (https://perell.com/essay/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online)

Remember, there's no substitute for writing a lot if you want to up your skills. You'll need to figure out how to constantly improve your craft...

I wish you good luck guys.
