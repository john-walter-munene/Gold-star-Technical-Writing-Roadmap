## Final Day: Unlocking Your Serendipity

Do you recall setting up multiple accounts - Twitter, LinkedIn - and installing communication channels like Slack and Discord? Assuming you have them, we'll use them to enter the Job Market. I have landed clients through referrals and them finding me through my high-ranking articles. But as for my first client, I met them on Twitter. The next one was on LinkedIn. And so on... How can you unlock your serendipity though?

I followed Karls's advice on landing my first technical writer opportunity helpful. (https://draft.dev/learn/finding-opportunities-as-an-entry-level-technical-writer) Make sure to join the WriteTheDocs community on slack. Link in the article.

When it comes to LinkedIn, you'll need to present yourself as a professional. Ensure your profile showcases your strengths and is outstanding from the crowd and noise... Here's some tips:

The above should be more than enough...

Remember when I told you to join micro-communities on Twitter? How does it work. You connect with members working on similar stuff to what you're doing. If you can share your learnings, it'll create your unique identity. Last year, I commited to writing three tweets based on my learnings and experiences. I gained 1000 followers in 8 months. Even after stopping my daily tweets, I have become an authority with a unique identity. And boy, its worling magic. Since then, I just retweet nice content, and I've since gained 400 new followers. Some are developers, marketers, writers, CEOs, and tech enthusiasts. Let's chat about it on X where I share my expertise in person.

But if you still need more guidance, I have a thread on job seeking:
