## Day 8: Great Writers to Learn From

As you hack your way through your first draft, I wanted to link you with the best writers I've encountered along my way. There's no particular order to how I've ranked them. How you interact with them is up to you. Some of them aren't in the technical content fields. But consuming great content is productive work for creators.

Nathan Barry, Karl Hughes, David Perell, David Ndii, Lizzie Davey, Rosanna Campbell, Austin L Church, Nikita Verma, Elna Cain, Nate Matherson, Fio D, Lee Densmer, Sarah Greesonbach, Debora Emeni, Linda Ikichekwu, Ashley Cummings, Wisdom Nwokocha...

I didn't point you to where to find them. But if you've been keen, you have everything you need so I'll leave you to figure it out.  

Happy learnings.
