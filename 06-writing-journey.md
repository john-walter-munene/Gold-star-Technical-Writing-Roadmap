You can choose from the many available types of technical content. The best place to start is:  

- [Technical tutorials](https://draft.dev/learn/technical-tutorials)  
- [Technical guides](https://draft.dev/learn/how-to-write-technical-guides)  
- [Technical Round ups](https://draft.dev/learn/writing-technical-roundups)  
- [Technical comparisons](https://draft.dev/learn/how-to-write-technical-comparisons)  

Other types of technical content you can explore as you grow include:  

- [Thought leadership](https://draft.dev/learn/how-to-write-technical-thought-leadership)  
- [Persuasive content](https://draft.dev/learn/how-to-write-persuasive-technical-content)
