## A Refresher on Grammar and Syntax — Day 2

### Why?

Great writing results from well-organized, clear thinking and a personal style. This means striking the balance of personal intuition, observations, and playfulness.  

But before we circle back to these, we'll need to be well conversant with the writing rules. If you think the rules don’t need revision, try reading something you wrote in 6th grade or at the start of high school — trust me, it'll hurt your brain.  

Although written by developers, the Google Technical Writing courses have been **standardized**: you’re writing for all audiences, embracing accessibility and worldwide inclusion.  

It’s time to take the **Google Technical Writing 1 and 2** courses:
